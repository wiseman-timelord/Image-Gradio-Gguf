# Image-Gradio-Gguf
Status: Beta (working but further development possible)
- [v1.07](https://github.com/wiseman-timelord/Image-Gradio-Gguf/releases/tag/v1.07) has installer that will likely work for AMD, may be liited on newest AMD, but the program was working well enough.
- v1.08-v1.16 has improved processor support for Intel chips, however due to recent crisis was unable to take time to test install, so I asume it does work for now.
- v1.17+ Will see Flux Klein integration, though this will be highly experimental, because I think it needs comfy UI, so will attempt to integrate it, but advanced features will possibly be limited, it may be generation only, or I may be able to have dynamic interface depending upon if using flux or z-image. We will see. I just want to get it working here, before I integrate it into my Agentic framework project, as a cheat sheet. Possibly I can just use the encoders here "Qwen3-Uncensored-TextEncoders-FLUX-Klein-Z-Image-Turbo-GGUF", for both, I have that encoder anyhow, downloading the Flux model "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/FLUX.2-klein-9B-GGUF" now. Start tomorrow. 

### Description
A local python image generator from prompt using Qwen 3 Z-Image Engineer encoder and Z-Image Turbo. This is a simple image generation project, covering what is possible currently to be most compitent through GGUF models, through but eventually cover several encoders and image generation models. While this program work great for what it does, it is also example scripts for AI on how to do image inference with such libraries/models, and useful in the production of other progreams that require such things. As you can see it generates OK images, they can look pretty real, but has the typical issues one would exoect under such restrictions and with AI image generation in general, but for simple images I think it will be effective in generating your result in a few iterations, so long as the request is not too barmy.

### Requirements:
- Operating System - Deepseek assesed this as Windows 10-11, however I am testing on Windows 10 22h2.
- Python - Deepseek assesed this as Python versions 3.11-3.13, however I am testing on Python 3.12.
- Graphics- Testing on Vulkan 1.3 card with newer driver. Also its a min DirectX 11.1 GPU for gradio/pyqt6 (browser interface).
- Processor - Detecting/supporting, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, AVX512, F16C, FMA, architecture features. Testing upon Zen 2 with AOCL installed. 
- Libraries - Required libraries is handled by the installer script, but they include both, Llama.Cpp and Stable Diffusion.
- Building - VS 2022 C++, specifically the Desktop Build Tools including CMake. Additionally the Vulkan 1.4 SDK. Additionally Windows 10/11 SDK relevant to your os version.

### Models...
I put Q# because it should support any quantization, the model variety will be expanded upon later....
- intended Encoding model, "Qwen3-4b-Z-Image-Turbo-AbliteratedV1.Q#.gguf" and "Qwen3-4b-Uncensored-Z-Image-Engineer-V4-Q#.gguf". Such as for example [Qwen3-Uncensored-TextEncoders-FLUX-Klein-Z-Image-Turbo-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/LuffyTheFox/Qwen3-Uncensored-TextEncoders-FLUX-Klein-Z-Image-Turbo-GGUF) or [Qwen3-4b-Z-Image-Turbo-AbliteratedV1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Qwen3-4b-Z-Image-Turbo-AbliteratedV1-GGUF)
- intended Image generation model "z_image_turbo-Q#.gguf" and "ae.safetensors". Such as for example [Z-Image-Turbo-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Z-Image-Turbo-GGUF).

### Instructions:
Currently...
```
1. Ensure you have downloaded the correct models from Huggingface, put them on your model storage drive (if you have one). You can put them in .\models if you like, but then this will cause a bloated folder, and you may not remember later. 
2. Ensure to download the latest release version to a suitable location, then unpack to the place you intend to have the program.
3. Run the program via right click run as admin on `Image-Gradio-Gguf.bat`, this will launch the batch menu.
4. Ensure that Python/Pip has internet access, these may request it during install (if that is an issue you may need to start install again), and the libraries/packages will install appropriately to the program folder, not globally. After which there will be a summary, and you will be returned to the batch menu. hopefully everything went ok for you. If there are any issues at this stage, I would suggest the installer should indicate what the issue was, so maybe paste that into AI with the installer script to fix your system compatibility.
5. Back on the batch menu, select 1 to run the application, the server will start up, and then the built-in browser will pop-up its own window with the Interface displayed. Ensure to go to Configuration page, to set model paths, and what is going to be loaded where, if there is not enough ram on the relating device, it will say in the output (see notes below). Adter configuring, go back to the Generation page, type in your positive prompt, and then hit generate. After you done your first image and everything is confirmed working, then possibly configure the settings further and produce a new prompt, and keep going til you have your images.
6. Upon exiting the program correctly through the exit button, the user will be returned to the batch menu, and one would then exit from there, or otherwise one could just click the [x] in the top right of all windows associated.
```

### Examples:
- If you want to test the image generation, then I suggested just write something like `A picture of a Woodchuck standing next to a pile of wood while juggling small logs of wood.`, I cant remember the exact prompt, but you can compare it to my picture of a Woodchuck standing next to a pile of wood and juggling small logs of wood.

### Notation:
- If you have older hardware, then I strongly advise generating 256x256 images unless you need them larger, as optimally 256x256 will take little time compared to 512x512 images. This is not such a problem if you have newer/expensive hardware. 
- As shown in the images on the readme.md, I was not able to load Z-Image-Turbo in Q4_KM completely to a 8GB GPU without using the option to put the ae.safetensors on the CPU, but I would not use less than a Q4_KM z-image-turbo. The Qwen3 4b Encoder model fits safely within 8GB, Encoding is a small task compared to diffusion.
- The Qwen3 encoder will do a good job of turning a bad prompt into something workable from a small input, but this is all experimental and an experiment too, so do not expect premium AI image quality, gguf versions of image generation models are sparse, you can see its slightly dated now because Qwen3 is the only encoder, but not that old that its naff. 

### Development:
Development is somewhat stopped for now due to, v1 done (working + nice) and funding issues, in the mean time you could check out my donation/sponsorship links on profile page, but there are still some improvements possible/planned...
- Done all noted improvements, though possibly will still noticinmg things that can be improved, see recent releases.
- Add AI edit image feature, ie outpaint, etc. Requires Flux-Klein support because Z-image-turbo only supports generation and not editing. The UI woudl also require a rethink, ie what are the options and how am I going to fit them in. It would also need a Qwen 3 Flux Klein Encoder. If you would like to see the project reach "add image editing via SD Klein and Qwen3 for SD", then please support via sponsor/donate via kofi/patreon, otherwise development may grind to a halt here at some unexpected point.
