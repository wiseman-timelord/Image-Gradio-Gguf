# Image-Gradio-Gguf
Status: Development/Alpha

### Description
A local python image generator from prompt using Qwen 3 Z-Image Engineer encoder and Z-Image Turbo. The program WiseMan-TimeLord probably should have done before doing other image based llm applications WiseMan-TimeLord have produced, this will be a simple image generation project, but eventually cover several encoders and image generation models.

### Requirements:
- Platform - Programming towards and testing upon, Windows 10 22h2 with Python 3.12, it may work on Windows 11 and nearby versions of Python. T.B.A.
- Graphics- Programming towards and testing upon, Vulkan 1.3 card with Vulkan 1.4 driver installed. Additionally CPU arcitecture features will be detected used when building for Vulkan including list shown below.
- Processor - Detecting/supporting, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, AVX512, F16C, FMA, architecture features. Testing upon Zen 2 with AOCL installed. CPU will always use by default 85% threads on the CPU.
- Libraries - Required libraries is handled by the installer script, but they include both, Llama.Cpp and Stable Diffusion.

### Models...
I put Q# because it should support any quantization, the model variety will be expanded upon later....
- intended Encoding model, "Qwen3-4b-Z-Image-Turbo-AbliteratedV1.Q#.gguf" and "Qwen3-4b-Uncensored-Z-Image-Engineer-V4-Q#.gguf
- intended Image generation model "z_image_turbo-Q#.gguf" and "ae.safetensors". (again this should cover all quantizations)

### Structure:
- Current plan for sripts is...

└── output/                        # Generated images directory
```

### Development:
A small program in python with gradio 5...
- Fixing inference.
- Last model location selected by browse, needs to be saved in a key in the json, and used when brose is selected, and the installer needs to create a json with that key with default value of ".\models". configure script json functions needs to loadingFromJsonToGlobals/SavingFromGlobalsToJson.
- Implementing PyQt (???), for built-in browser, for fake application style interface.
- Test inference.
- Add edit image feature.

### Design
- Page 1 the Interaction page- it will have a text box with a generate button underneath, to the side of that will be configurations for image generation, with dropdown list for reasonable values and sensible default settings and sensible ranges in the lists.
- Page 2 the Configuration page - Where the user configures, model location used for, 1. encoding and 2. image generation, these would require display of current path and a browse button, Additionally page 2 would have whatever configurations are required for these models, individually, with dropdown list for reasonable values and sensible default settings and sensible ranges in the lists.
- Page 3 the Debug/Info page - showing useful values, that actually change, not constants, ensure its all in a text box too, with a little copy button so I could paste it back during development.
